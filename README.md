## ðŸ“– What does CipherChat want to achieve?

CipherChat mainly tries to achieve the following:
- End-to-end encryption
- Easy to use even for normal users
- Anonymity of every user and server through the TOR network

The code should be easily understandable and verifiable so that the security can be checked and verified by several authorities, which also helps to find zero-day exploits more quickly.
