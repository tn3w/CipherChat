# As a hidden service operator, you should write information for the user in this file, which he should consider for maximum security
# If you don't add any new techniques to your website, this file should inform the user as much as possible.

~~ Introduction ~~
Welcome to CipherChat's security information, this document will tell you how to protect your anonymity. You can find more information in the Darknet Bible: http://biblemeowimkh3utujmhm6oh2oeb3ubjw2lpgeq3lahrfr2l6ev6zgyd.onion
*~* This hidden service uses the beta version of CipherChat, which means that the function may not work yet, there may still be bugs. *~*

~~ Features of CipherChat ~~
1. Anonymous Registration / Login:
    Users can register without revealing any personal information, ensuring anonymity from the get-go. It uses 2 factor verification, which is generated when registering on the client side. The server then sends a captcha to protect the server against bots as well. 
    Important: Do not use your real name as a username, or anything else that can be associated with you, it is best to generate a random string e.g. "k9ob" and use it.
2. TOR Integration:
    All requests are sent over the TOR network, with a secure bridge that hides that you are using TOR.
    Do not use the CipherChat client if you notice that no TOR connection can be established or you notice that no bridge is being used.
3. End-to-End Encryption:
    All data is end-to-end encrypted, if you have disabled persistent storage, your private key with your account password will be sent encrypted to the server that stores it, this must be done this way, otherwise you would not be able to decrypt messages after a session. In addition, old chat messages/files will be deleted after a session. All data of the persistent storage is encrypted with the persistent storage password (including your private key and e.g. old chat messages)
    Note that the persistent storage password and the account password of a hidden service or other hidden services should be different.
4. Secure Erase:
    If you want to delete all your files when typing a command 'python main.py -k' or 'python main.py --killswitch', it does this by overwriting the files with Gutmann Parterns, DoD 5220.22-M and random data.
    Make sure that you haven't made any copies and that there are no files + content in your operating system's trash can
5. Self-Destructing Messages:
    Messages and files are deleted from the server after a query.

~~ Best Practices for Maintaining Anonymity ~~
Avoid Revealing Personal Information:
    Refrain from sharing identifying details that could compromise your anonymity.
Use TOR Securely:
    Ensure that TOR is properly configured and always active while using the platform. Avoid accessing non-TOR websites simultaneously.
Regularly Update:
    Make sure you have the latest version of CipherChat on your system.
Beware of Malicious Links:
    Do not click on links from untrusted sources, as they could lead to phishing attempts or compromise your anonymity.
Use Strong, Unique Passwords:
    Create a strong password for your account, and avoid using the same password on other platforms to prevent cross-platform identification.
Secure Your Device:
    Keep your device secure with up-to-date antivirus software and firewalls to prevent any potential breaches.
Monitor Account Activity:
    Regularly review your account activity and log out from shared devices to prevent unauthorized access.

~~ Potential Risks and Mistakes ~~
Sharing Personal Information:
    Revealing personal details, even unintentionally, can compromise your anonymity.
Ignoring Software Updates:
    Neglecting platform updates can leave you vulnerable to security flaws that have been patched in newer versions.
Clicking on Suspicious Links:
    Clicking on links from unknown sources can lead to phishing attempts, potentially revealing your identity.
Using Weak Passwords:
    A weak password makes it easier for malicious actors to gain unauthorized access to your account.

Remember, your anonymity is crucial.
